# Art Gallery
Operating Systems Project 3

Overview
	A new art gallery has opened up, due to law restrictions only a certain amount of customers are allowed to enter the gallery at one time.
	Your task is to limit the amount of customers that are entering the gallery and if there is space for people to enter, then allow them to enter.
	Your program will allow the user to input two numbers. One being the max customers allowed into the gallery and another being the number of customers that are lined up to visit the gallery.

Sample Output:
	//Inputs: customer_number = 30, max_customers = 10
